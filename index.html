		<h2>About Me</h2> 
		<img src= "./assets/images/unnamed.jpg" height= 125px width= 125px>
		<p> My name is Andrew Gonzalez and I love creating things such as foods, jokes, and now html pages linked to CSS. I moved from Miami to Orlando to jump into the world of web development. I knew it would be a difficult program and thought of it as a way to broaden my horizons. Hopefully by the end of this program I can create my own sites and apps without having to pay someone else, and get a real job. In the future I'd like to have some kind of food/lifestyle application and/or website. I'm excited to see what this coding bootcamp has to offer.
